We present a novel approach that enables a target speaker
(e.g. monolingual Chinese speaker) to speak a new language
(e.g. English) based on arbitrary textual input. Our system in-
cludes a trained English speaker-independent automatic speech
recognition (SI-ASR) engine using TIMIT. Given the target
speaker’s speech in a non-target language, we generate Phonetic
PosteriorGrams (PPGs) with the SI-ASR and then train a Deep
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neu-
ral Networks (DBLSTM) to model the relationships between
the PPGs and the acoustic signal. Synthesis involves input of
arbitrary text to a general TTS engine (trained on any non-
target speaker), the output of which is indexed by SI-ASR as
PPGs. These are used by the DBLSTM to synthesize the target
language in the target speaker’s voice. A main advantage of this
approach has very low training data requirement of the target
speaker which can be in any language, as compared with a
reference approach of training a special TTS engine using many
recordings from the target speaker only in the target language.
For a given target speaker, our proposed approach trained on
100 Mandarin (i.e. non-target language) utterances achieves
comparable performance (in MOS and ABX test) of English
synthetic speech as an HTS system trained on 1,000 English
utterances.
